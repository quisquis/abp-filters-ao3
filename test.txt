! Title: AO3 Tag Blocker - Test
! Last modified: 12/22/20
! Expires: 4 days (update frequency)
! Homepage: 
! 
! block by keyword:
archiveofourown.org#?#li.group:-abp-has(li:-abp-contains(/Mineta|mineta/))
! this will get any tag with 'mineta' in it
! it's more flexible, which means it will also get tags like 'Alternate Universe - Mineta Minoru Doesn't Exist' and 'Shinsou Hitoshi Replaces Mineta Minoru'

! block by exact tag:
archiveofourown.org#?#li.group:-abp-has(a[href*="/Mineta%20Minoru/" i])
! this will target the exact tag 'Mineta Minoru'
! it's more strict, which means it will miss less common variations of the tag like 'Minoru Mineta'
