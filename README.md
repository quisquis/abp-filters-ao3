# abp-filters-ao3
Block tags on Archive of Our Own using an ad blocker (like Adblock Plus / uBlock Origin / etc.)

## Filters
**Block a work if a tag contains a keyword:**

archiveofourown.org#?#li.group:-abp-has(li:-abp-contains(/First Tag|Second Tag|Third Tag/))

**Block a work if a tag has an exact match:**

archiveofourown.org#?#li.group:-abp-has(a[href*="/First%20Tag/" i], a[href*="/Second%20Tag/" i], a[href*="/Third%20Tag/" i])
